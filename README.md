This code is an early release. You will need [pyTFA](https://github.com/EPFL-LCSB/pytfa) and [ETFL](https://github.com/EPFL-LCSB/etfl) to run it. We recommend using commercial solvers such as CPLEX or Gurobi to run these problems.

For further details, see [ETFL's instruction](https://github.com/EPFL-LCSB/etfl/blob/master/README.rst).

To run the scripts, the data that is deposited in [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/4778047#.YKfF8OvRY6U) is needed.
